# Hands-On Experience with Weka: Classifier Selection for Human Fall Detection  

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project showcases my hands-on experience with **Weka**, a powerful machine learning tool for data preprocessing, classifier selection, and model evaluation. The project focuses on analyzing **human fall angle data** and testing five popular classifiers to build and evaluate predictive models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview  
This repository contains the implementation, analysis, and detailed reporting of classifier performance for a **human fall detection dataset**. The main objectives of this project are:  
1. To explore and understand Weka as a machine learning tool.  
2. To perform classifier selection and compare their performance.  
3. To generate a comprehensive report on the models, including performance metrics and time taken for training.

## üìö Classifiers Used  
The following classifiers were tested and evaluated using Weka:  
- **Na√Øve Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.  
- **J48 (Decision Tree)**: A decision tree algorithm for classification tasks.  
- **Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting)**: An ensemble technique that combines weak classifiers.  
- **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**: A feedforward artificial neural network.  
- **SVM (Sequential Minimal Optimization)**: A supervised learning model for classification tasks.
